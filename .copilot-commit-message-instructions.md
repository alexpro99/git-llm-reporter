# Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This provides an easy-to-follow set of rules for creating an explicit commit history.

## Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Header

The header is mandatory and should be a single line that contains a succinct description of the change.

-   **type**: Must be one of the following:
    -   `feat`: A new feature
    -   `fix`: A bug fix
    -   `docs`: Documentation only changes
    -   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    -   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    -   `perf`: A code change that improves performance
    -   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    -   `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
    -   `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
    -   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files
    -   `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

-   **scope** (optional): A noun specifying the place of the commit change. For example, `feat(api): ...` or `fix(parser): ...`.

-   **description**: A short summary of the code changes.
    -   Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
    -   Don't capitalize the first letter.
    -   No dot (.) at the end.

### Body (Optional)

The body is for additional contextual information about the code changes. It should be used to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*.

-   Use the imperative, present tense.
-   Separate the body from the header with a blank line.

### Footer (Optional)

The footer is for referencing issue tracker IDs or breaking changes.

-   **Breaking Changes**: Should start with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then the description of the change, justification, and migration notes.
-   **Referencing issues**: Use keywords like `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`.

## Example

```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Implement a new authentication strategy using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
This replaces the old session-based authentication system.

- The new `/login` endpoint now returns a JWT.
- The client should store this token and send it in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication mechanism has been changed.
All API clients must be updated to handle JWTs. Session-based authentication is no longer supported.

Closes #34
```
